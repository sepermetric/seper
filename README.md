# SePer: Official Implementation

This repository contains the official implementation of our ICLR 2025 **Spotlight** paper:

**SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity Reduction**

Authors: Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong

**Note**: This page is still under construction. We will release the code and data soon.

## Overview

SePer introduces a novel framework to evaluate retrieval utility by analyzing **semantic perplexity** and **semantic perplexity reduction**. This approach provides a more fine-grained measurement of retrieval utility, offering insights beyond traditional evaluation metrics.

## Benchmark For Retrievers

The benchmark for retrievers is available at [here](https://sepermetric.github.io/).
